   # --- YOUR RAG LOGIC GOES HERE ---
   # This is where you will implement the core functionality of your hackathon project.
  
   # 1. Download the PDF from the `request_data.documents` URL.
   # 2. Load and split the PDF into text chunks.
   # 3. Generate embeddings for each chunk.
   # 4. Store the chunks and their embeddings in a vector database (like Pinecone).
   # 5. For each question in `request_data.questions`:
   #    a. Generate an embedding for the question.
   #    b. Query the vector DB to find the most relevant text chunks.
   #    c. Combine the question and the relevant chunks into a prompt for an LLM (like GPT-4).
   #    d. Get the answer from the LLM.
   # 6. Collect all the answers.
  
  

# To run this app:
# 1. Save the code as `main.py`.
# 2. Make sure you have the necessary libraries:
#    pip install "fastapi[all]"
# 3. Run the server from your terminal:
#    uvicorn main:app --reload
